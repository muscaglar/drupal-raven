[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sphereci/drupal-raven.svg?branch=8.x)](https://travis-ci.org/sphereci/drupal-raven)

This module allows users to log into a Drupal site using [Raven](http://raven.cam.ac.uk/), the University of Cambridge's central authentication service.

Developer for the [Magdalene College](https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/).

Users can log into an existing account assuming their CRSid has been used as their username, otherwise a new account is created (if your site allows visitors to create accounts).
